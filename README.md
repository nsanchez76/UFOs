# UFOs

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage containing an interactive table.  This table provides users the ability to filter 
the UFO sigtings data for multiple criteria at the same time, specifically city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. 
Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
The UFO Finder is very easy to use. When the page initially loads, it will display all the UFO sitings data in a table format. There are four (4) filters that can be used to display different sub-sets of the data.

The "Enter Date" filter can be used to display data for a date.


The "Enter City" filter can be used to display data for a specific city.


The "Enter Country" filter can be used to display data for a specific country.


The "Enter Shape" filter can be used to display data based on the shape of the sighting.


The user can also filter the data using a combination of the 4 filters, as seen here:




## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
