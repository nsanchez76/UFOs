# UFOs

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage containing an interactive table.  This table provides users the ability to filter 
the UFO sigtings data for multiple criteria at the same time, specifically city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
The UFO Finder is very easy to use. When the page initially loads, it will display all the UFO sitings data in a table format. There are five (5) filters that can be used to display different sub-sets of the data.

The "Enter Date" filter can be used to display data for a date.

The "Enter City" filter can be used to display data for a specific city.

The "Enter State" filter can be used to display data for a specific state.

The "Enter Country" filter can be used to display data for a specific country.

The "Enter Shape" filter can be used to display data based on the shape of the sighting.

The user can also filter the data using a combination of the 4 filters, as seen here:

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

In summary, the UFO Finder is very useful, but there is a drawback in that the data is limited to sightings in the US.
A recommendation to enhance the usefulness of this page would be to gather more data from around the globe so that users can filter
and compare sightings from a global perspective. Another recommendation would be to add another filter for "Duration" of the sigting
to determine if there are any sightings with similar durations.
